                        <strong>Did</strong> you know that over 30% of Canada's school children are either immigrants themselves or have at least one parent that was born abroad? That's a highly significant number! So when people immigrate to Canada, it's important that both parents and children feel comfortable with the educational system. And the first step to feeling comfortable? Understanding. So today we will discuss everything an immigrant needs to know about the Educational system in Canada.

                                <li>Settlement Workers in Schools (SWIS) - These are people who are available to help newcomer families and students when they first move to Canada.

                            </ol>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>In Canada, your child is required to be immunized against specific diseases.</strong> Your doctor will provide you with a list of your child's immunizations, which you will take to the school to provide them with up to date records.
                        </li>

                        <li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Keep in mind that even if you do not have all of the above documents, all children aged 6-18 have the right to a publicly funded education in Canada. When it comes to immigration, children may attend school regardless of their families access to documentation. Children may not be denied the right to education based on their, or their parents immigration status. Canada seeks to protect the rights of all individuals living in and coming to the country.  One way they do this is by offering publicly funded education to everyone.
