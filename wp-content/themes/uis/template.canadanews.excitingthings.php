                        <strong>Canada</strong> is an amazing country – from lakes, to mountains, to icebergs, wildlife, and hustling and bustling cities, Canada has everything you could ever want all in one place. Today we will go cross to country to find the most exciting things to do in this beautiful and wonderful land. 
					</p>

						<strong>10. Explore Newfoundland (Newfoundland)</strong>
						</br></br>
						If you only had time to visit one province in all of Canada, Newfoundland might be our best recommendation. This colorful province may be relatively small, but its personality is massive. Explore the rows of colorful houses in St. Johns,   visit the picturesque town of Trinity, or search for Puffin birds along the coast. And when in Newfoundland, take the path less travelled – you never know what kind of treasures you will find in this province full of personality and shine!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>9. Take an Iceberg Tour (Newfoundland)</strong>
						</br></br>
						While in Newfoundland, you can‘t miss out on the opportunity to take an iceberg tour. Newfoundland has actually been listed as one of the best places in the world to take an iceberg tour, and some of these giants are over 10, 000 years old! Approximately 90% of Newfoundland’s icebergs come from the glaciers of western Greenland, and the other 10% stroll in from the Canadian Arctic. But regardless of where they come from, they are an ancient sight that is not to be missed. Travel to Newfoundland in April or May for your best chance at catching a glimpse at these beauties.

						<strong>8. Swim with whales (Newfoundland)</strong>
						</br></br>
						If you have ever been on a whale watching tour and wondered what it might be like to get a little bit closer to this amazing species, well, now you can! Another amazing opportunity in Newfoundland, one Tour Company known as Ocean Quest Adventures takes you more up close and personal than ever to the Humpback whale. Visit Newfoundland throughout the summer months to have the once-in-a –lifetime opportunity to swim up beside these majestic creatures for an experience that you will never forget!

					</p>
					
					<p>
						<strong>7. Explore Peggy’s Cove (Nova Scotia)</strong>
						</br></br>
						Moving onto our next province, Nova Scotia is full of breathtaking scenery. But if you were to ask a number of people what their first thought is of when they hear Nova Scotia, many will tell you they think of the many lighthouses that line the coast. This is because Nova Scotia is home to over 150 lighthouses throughout the province. The most popular of them all is Peggy’s Cove. A sight not to be missed, Peggy’s Cove is one of the most photographed areas in all of Canada. Located in a small fishing village, Peggy’s Cove is home to one of the most famous lighthouses in the world. But what makes this lighthouse so famous is not the lighthouse itself, but the massive and astonishing rock formations that surround it. But trust us - the pictures don’t even begin to do justice! One trip to Peggy’s Cove and you will know exactly what we are talking about.

						<strong>6. Drive the Cabot Trail (Nova Scotia) </strong>
						</br></br>
						The Cabot Trail is a scenic and picturesque roadway that takes you around the greater part of Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. One of the most famous drives in Canada, this roadway offers a variety of scenic overlooks, cultural heritage sites, and hiking trails. Along the way you might even see some wildlife like seals or moose!  The trip around the trail itself can be done in less than a day, but if you are an avid explorer, you might want to set aside a few days to explore everything the trail has to offer. And for an authentic experience, make sure you check out a ceilidh along your way. This is a traditional Scottish or Irish gathering where people come together to listen to Gaelic folk music and have a good ol’ square dance. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<strong>5. Spend the night in an Ice Hotel (Quebec)</strong>
						</br></br>
						If you are looking for a truly unique experience, don’t miss the opportunity to spend the night in your very own iced room. The ice hotel in Quebec is the only ice hotel in North America and is definitely something to behold. Made entirely of ice and snow, this architectural piece is constructed every winter and is only open from December to March Months. The hotel features everything you would expect a regular hotel to feature, including a Great Hall, a chapel, a bar – and even an ice slide. The hotel is open for tours or, if you’re feeling extra adventurous, you can rock your very own parka and spend the night in your very own iced room. Can you make it through the night?

						<strong>4. Visit Niagara Falls (Ontario)</strong>
						</br></br>
						Niagara Falls is listed as one of the top tourist destinations in the entire world, experiencing over 30 million visitors each year. Despite the fact that most people think Niagara Falls is one giant waterfall, it’s actually 3. Niagara Falls consists of the American Falls, the Bridal Veil Falls, and the Horseshoe (Canadian) falls. The Horseshoe Falls are both the longest and tallest of all the falls, spanning over 792 meters in length and reaching over 51 meters tall!

					</p>
					
					<p>
						<strong>3. Explore the Rocky Mountains (Alberta and British Columbia)</strong>
						</br></br>
						Most commonly referred to as “The Rockies”, the Rocky Mountain range actually represents a series of more than 100 separate mountain formations. They stretch over 4, 800km from Alberta to British Columbia, and then into the US through Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. But no matter where you start your travels through them, amazing photo opportunities are all around. Not only are the mountains themselves an amazing sight to see, but if travelling through Alberta and British Columbia, there are also a massive number of sightseeing stops throughout the way. Explore the Icefields Parkway, take a tour onto a giant glacier in the Columbia Icefields, hike through Yoho National Park, take a tram tour in Banff, enjoy the crystal clear waters at Lake Louise, laze in hot springs, and always have your camera ready for wildlife spotting on the side of the road!

					<p>
						<strong>2. Go Whale Watching (British Columbia)</strong>
						</br></br>
						Vancouver is one of the best places in the world to go whale watching. Throughout the March to October seasons, thousands of whales migrate through these waters. And while orcas are generally the main attraction here, you might also see humpbacks, gray whales, and minke whales. A variety of whale watching tours are offered throughout Vancouver. So whether you like to stay dry on a larger boat, hop on a high speed zodiac, watch whales from above in a sea-plane, or get up close and personal in a kayak, there are dozens of tours to choose from that will give you a better insight into the lives of some of the most beautiful mammals in the ocean.

						<strong>1. Go on a Polar Bear Safari</strong>
						</br></br>
						One of the less-well-known attractions in Canada (but our absolute favorite) is hidden away way up in Northern Manitoba. Located up in Churchill are a number of Polar Bear Safari lodges where you can actually watch Polar Bears right outside your lodge window! Several tour operators will even take you one step further, getting up close and personal with Polar bears in Tundra vehicles and even on Polar Bear Photo safaris. And while Polar Bears are the main attraction up here in Northern Manitoba, we must not forget that Churchill also offers the once in a lifetime opportunity to hop in the water with Beluga Whales! Unfortunately, these amazing opportunities do not come cheap – but they are well worth every penny!
