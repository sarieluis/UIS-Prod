                        <strong>New</strong> to Canada? Canada is one of the most welcoming and diverse countries in the world, and does everything it can to make it’s newest residents feel welcomed and comfortable. But Canada is a large land and navigating the best place to live can sometimes be a difficult task. So today we’ve compiled a list of the top 5 cities for immigrants to live in Canada:
                    </p>
					
					<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Toronto, Ontario is by far one of the most diverse cities in all of Canada. In fact, almost 50% of all Toronto’s population were born foreignly. And the one thing that makes Toronto so unique is that there is not one group that significantly dominates any others. Rather, it seems that all cultural groups are spread out equally through this large and populous city. What drives immigrants to Toronto the most is the vast number of opportunities that are available here. Toronto is extremely open to newcomers, and offers a variety of programs to help immigrants integrate into the educational system or workforce. The main downfall here, however, is the rising costs of living. Currently, according to the Huffington Post, the average cost of housing in Toronto is over $1, 672.13 per month. With that being said, the opportunity to make vast amounts of money also present in Toronto. Here is a quick breakdown of some things to know about Toronto:  
							</br></br>
							<strong>Percentage of immigrants:</strong> Almost 50%</br>
							<strong>Average salary:</strong> $58, 224 per year.</strong></br>
							<strong>Crime Rate:</strong> 59% CSI rating (Crime Severity Index Rating).
							</br></br>
							<strong>Growth Plan:</strong> As Toronto’s population continues to grow, the city is continuing to develop new housing strategies to establish more affordable housing options, and suggests that public transit is of top priority regarding transportation infrastructure. The city is also looking for ways to start developing prime agricultural areas, and are putting water and waste systems at the top of the priority list.

						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Calgary</strong></br></br>
							Like Toronto, Calgary is a large city. In fact, it is the largest city in all of Alberta and the third largest urban area in all of Canada. And while Ontario still remains the number one province for immigration, Alberta is slowly creeping up behind. From 2011 to 2016 alone, over 207, 790 people immigrated to Alberta from other countries. But the catch here is that most immigrants being attracted to Alberta fall under the “economic” category. These include people that were “nominated” to move here because they fit an economic need such as skilled trade workers, live-in caregivers, and investors. Here is a breakdown of what you need to know about Calgary:

							</div></br>
							<strong>Percentage of Immigrants:</strong> 26.2%</br>
							<strong>Average Salary:</strong> $60, 588 per year.</br>
							<strong>Crime Rate:</strong> CSI rating of 29%</br></br>
							
							<strong>Growth plan:</strong> As the population in Calgary and Alberta becomes more diverse, the province tends to place more emphasis on helping foreign professionals get the credentials they deserve. This could include more efficient ways of recognizing or upgrading their current credentials, instead of having to receive certification all over again. The province also intends to put a greater deal of emphasis on schools and community centres to make the transition to Canada an easier one. 			
							</br></br>						
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Ottawa</strong></br></br>  
							Ottawa is the Nation’s capital, and is always a safe place for immigrants to land. What attracts immigrants the most to Ottawa is that it has actually been listed as one of the best places to live in all of Canada. The main reason for this is because of the high quality of life that it offers, versus the low cost of living. Ottawa is a young city with a strong economy, and it’s population is quickly diversifying. In fact, one in four Ottawa residents are immigrants. If you are considering immigrating to Ottawa, here are a few things you should know:
							</br></br>
							<strong>Percentage of immigrants :</strong> 25%</br>
							<strong>Average salary:</strong> $53, 030 per year.</br>
							<strong>Crime rate:</strong> CSI rating of 52%</br></br>
							
							<strong>Growth plan:</strong> After Toronto, Ottawa is the second largest destination in Canada for newcomers. In the next 20 years, the population is expected to reach over 1.2 million residents. In response, Ottawa is looking at putting in a new rail system, developing new high rise buildings, and revitalizing the downtown core. They also intend to open up the gates for new housing projects for communities outside the Greenbelt, and developing new ideas for homes for the aging population.

						<li>
							<strong>Mississauga</strong></br></br>
							Mississauga, located just outside of Toronto, is actually considered a suburb of Toronto. With that being said, it’s also the third largest city in all of Ontario. It’s main draw is that it is only a 20 minute drive, or a quick hop on the bus, to downtown Toronto - without the same costs as the Toronto housing market. Currently, over 53% of the Mississauga population is immigrants, and there are plenty of programs to help newcomers integrate into the Canadian system. The downfall is that the unemployment rate in Mississauga is much higher than other suburbs of Toronto.  
							</br></br>
							<strong>Percentage of Immigrants:</strong> 53%</br>
							<strong>Average Salary:</strong> $50, 039</br>
							<strong>Crime Rate:</strong> CSI rating of 43%</br></br>
							
							<strong>Growth Plan:</strong> As the population of Mississauga continues to grow and becomes even more diverse, the city intends to create over 250, 000 new jobs. By 2041, the region is expected to accommodate over 2 million residents and hopes to have over 1 million jobs readily available. Such jobs are expected to be most highly related to the environment, natural resources, employment, health, and housing industries.

						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Richmond BC</strong></br></br>
							Richmond BC, which is a suburb of Vancouver, is located only 30 minutes from the downtown core. Again, Richmond is one of the most diverse cities in all of Canada. In fact, their immigration rate is over 60 percent! That means that there are more immigrants in the city than there are actual Canadian borns. The best thing about Richmond is that the salaries here are higher than they are in the actual city itself, and the cost of living is much lower. Instead of spending all your money on housing in Vancouver, you can live in Richmond and just hop on the bus to work. Here are some other stats you should know: 
							</br></br>
							<strong>Percentage of Immigrants:</strong> 60%</br> 
							<strong>Average salary:</strong> $55, 801 per year.</br>
							<strong>Crime rate:</strong> CSI rating of 76%</br></br>
							
							<strong>Growth plan:</strong> Future plans for the city of Richmond are highly focused on the development of new transit systems to and from the city. The city also intends to place a great deal of focus on sustaining single family neighborhoods, farmlands, natural environments, and open spaces that make Richmond such a desirable place to live. While the land supports a great deal of growth, the city also hopes to sustain much of what already is. 
							</br></br>
							If you are planning on immigrating to Canada, these are just a few of your many options. Keep in mind that these are just our top 5 suggestions, but the truth is, you can’t really go wrong no matter where you move in Canada. The entire country is beautiful and open to immigrants, new ideas, and diversity.
